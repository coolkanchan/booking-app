### Slide 11: Sequence Diagram (Book a Flight)
**Sequence Diagram: Booking a Flight**  
- **Actors**: Traveler, Frontend (React), Backend (Spring Boot), Database  
- **Steps**:  
  1. Traveler submits a booking request via the frontend.  
  2. Frontend sends POST /api/booking with CreateBookingCommand.  
  3. Backend (BookingController) receives the request.  
  4. BookingController calls BookingCommandHandler.handle.  
  5. BookingCommandHandler validates flights using FlightRepository.  
  6. BookingCommandHandler saves the booking via BookingRepository.  
  7. Database persists the booking and related FlightLeg entities.  
  8. Backend returns the created Booking to the frontend.  
  9. Frontend displays a confirmation to the traveler.

## 4. Software Design Patterns, OOA/D, and SWE Principles (Presented by Williams - Backend Engineer)

### Slide 12: Design Patterns
**Software Design Patterns**  
- **Command Pattern**:  
  - Used in BookingCommandHandler with CreateBookingCommand to encapsulate booking creation logic.  
  - Benefits: Decouples the request from its execution, making the system modular.  
- **Repository Pattern**:  
  - Used in BookingRepository, FlightRepository to abstract database operations.  
  - Benefits: Centralizes data access logic, improves testability.  
- **Dependency Injection**:  
  - Used in Spring Boot (e.g., @Autowired in BookingController).  
  - Benefits: Promotes loose coupling and easier testing.  

---

### Slide 13: Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOA/D)
**Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOA/D)**  
- **Analysis**:  
  - Identified entities (User, Flight, Booking, etc.) and their relationships based on use cases.  
  - Defined roles (Traveler, Admin) and their interactions with the system.  
- **Design**:  
  - Used encapsulation (e.g., private fields in entities with getters/setters).  
  - Applied composition (e.g., FlightLeg composes a Flight).  
  - Ensured single responsibility (e.g., BookingQueryHandler for queries, BookingCommandHandler for commands).  

---

### Slide 14: Software Engineering Principles
**Software Engineering Principles**  
- **SOLID Principles**:  
  - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class has one responsibility (e.g., BookingController handles HTTP requests).  
  - Open/Closed Principle (OCP): System is extensible (e.g., new endpoints can be added without modifying existing code).  
  - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules depend on abstractions via dependency injection.  
- **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)**:  
  - Reused components like NavButton in the frontend and shared logic in the backend.  
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**:  
  - Kept the API design simple (RESTful endpoints with clear purposes).  

---

## 5. Frontend Implementation (Presented by Mercel - Frontend Engineer)

### Slide 15: Frontend Overview
**Frontend Implementation**  
- Built with React, TypeScript, and Material-UI for a modern, responsive UI.  
- Uses React Router for navigation and Context API for state management.  

---

### Slide 16: Key Components
**Key Components**  
- **Header**:  
  - Dynamic navbar with role-based links (e.g., “Management” for admins).  
  - User menu with profile, bookings, and logout options.  
- **Management Dashboard**:  
  - Tabbed interface for managing bookings, flights, and complaints.  
  - Features: Tables with CRUD operations, form dialogs with validation, dropdowns for Airline and Airport.  
- **Login/Signup**:  
  - Modal for user authentication, integrated with AuthContext.

---

### Slide 17: UI/UX Design
**UI/UX Design**  
- Consistent theme (blue palette: #1e3c72, #2a5298).  
- Responsive design with Material-UI components (e.g., Table, Dialog, Tabs).  
- User feedback: Loading spinners, error alerts, confirmation dialogs.

---

### Slide 18: Frontend Challenges and Solutions
**Frontend Challenges and Solutions**  
- **Challenge**: Handling nested data (e.g., flight.airline.name).  
  - **Solution**: Used optional chaining (?.) and fallback values (|| 'N/A').  
- **Challenge**: Form validation for flight creation.  
  - **Solution**: Added client-side validation before API calls.  

**Screenshot Placeholder**:  
![Demo Video](screenshots/demo-video-placeholder.png)  
*Note*: Embed a 1-2 minute demo video showing a user booking a flight and an admin managing flights.

## 6. Deployment and DevOps (Presented by Kanchan - DevOps Engineer)

### Slide 19: Deployment Strategy
**Deployment Strategy**  
- **Frontend**: Deployed on Netlify.  
  - Build command: npm run build.  
  - Deployed as a static site, connecting to the backend via API calls.  
- **Backend**: Deployed on AWS EC2.  
  - Packaged as a JAR file using mvn package.  
  - Deployed with a PostgreSQL database.  

---

### Slide 20: CI/CD Pipeline
**CI/CD Pipeline**  
- **Tools**: GitHub Actions.  
- **Pipeline**:  
  - On push to main:  
    - Frontend: Build, test, and deploy to Netlify.  
    - Backend: Build, test, package, and deploy to AWS.  
  - Tests: Unit tests for backend (JUnit), frontend tests (Jest).

---

### Slide 21: Environment Setup and Monitoring
**Environment Setup and Monitoring**  
- **Development**: Local setup with localhost:3000 (frontend) and localhost:8080 (backend).  
- **Production**: Configured environment variables (e.g., VITE_API_URL, database credentials).  
- **Monitoring**: Used AWS CloudWatch for backend logs and metrics.  
- **Scaling**: Configured auto-scaling on AWS EC2 to handle traffic spikes.  

---

### Slide 22: Security
**Security**  
- HTTPS for all API calls.  
- JWT token stored in localStorage (consider HttpOnly cookies for production).  
- CORS configured to allow http://localhost:3000 in development.
